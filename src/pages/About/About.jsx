                <p className="contact-description">Hey there [you reading]! ðŸš€ I'm Martin, a Mid QA Engineer with nearly 4 years of navigating the wild territories of games, web, and mobile. Picture me as your trusty bug-hunting sidekick in the digital realm, armed with a huuuge passion for gaming. When I'm not wrangling bugs, you'll find me in the coding dojo, honing my skills in web development. By day, I'm an ever-learning QA kinda-hero; by night, a Full-Stack Web Development wizard wannabe... (Rather goblin, but well). And yes, I do wear a cape in both scenarios. Aaand, during my free time, well... I L O V E retro games, both playing them AND developing my own ones as well. I am currently working on some personal projects involving pixel art and Lua, and will soon get into C as well. I do love algorithms, and I've got a knack for finding memory-saving tricks, so it all runs faster than you can say "404 error." Soft skills? Ah, yes, I've got some of those too â€” team player, problem-solving aficionado, always up for a new challenge... Townsfolk say I am a fast learner, but I assure you, it's just a really fast internet connection.</p>

                <p className="contact-description">Hello world! I'm Andrea, theater actress in my spare time and full-time full-stack programmer. When I'm not immersed in the world of code, I find myself on stage, playing characters and telling stories.The connection between theatre and programming is surprisingly deep. In theatre, each performance is like executing a program, where each line of dialogue and body movement is like a line of code that contributes to the end result. As with programming, theatre requires creativity, attention to detail and teamwork to achieve a successful performance. In addition, both in theatre and in programming, it is a question of communicating ideas effectively: in theatre, through emotional expression and narration, and in programming, through the creation of interfaces and the functionality of software. In short, both disciplines are art forms that require dedication, technical skills and a passion for storytelling and creating memorable experiences. Whether on stage or in front of the screen, I am committed to the art of communication and creation. See you at the next act or the next line of code!</p>
